1
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,130
What does it do?
We won't stop here.

2
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,928
Get out of the car.

3
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,998
The boys found this...

4
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,558
...on the floor in the back
of the Cadillac.

5
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,086
Yes. You already showed it to me.

6
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,118
It might not be related.

7
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,727
It could be.

8
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,967
Some of the victims
Did she wear pearl earrings?

9
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,767
Maybe someone is missing.

10
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,967
That's what I believe.

11
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,646
Just one more suitcase after that.

12
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:19,006
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:21,364
To Winkies?

14
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,525
To this Winkies.

15
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,044
Why this Winkies?

16
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,606
It's a little embarrassing.

17
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:38,925
Tell me.

18
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,117
I dreamed of this place.

19
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,715
Wow.

20
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,844
Now do you understand?

21
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,884
You dreamed about this place.

22
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:53,965
Tell me.

23
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,284
Well...

24
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,916
...it's the second time I dream about him...

25
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,005
...but the two dreams were the same.

26
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,676
Start with me here...

27
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:11,965
...but it is not day or night.

28
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:15,916
It's almost night, you understand?

29
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,637
But this is what I see.

30
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,765
Except the light.

31
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:24,603
And I'm very scared.

32
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,916
And none other than you...

33
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,284
...you are standing there...

34
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:37,483
...next to that bar.

35
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:42,724
You were in both dreams,
and very scared.

36
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:48,084
I get more scared
when I see how scared you are, and...

37
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,805
...then I realize what's happening.

38
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,125
There is a man...

39
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,843
...in the back of this place.

40
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:07,044
He is the one who is doing it.

41
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:11,084
I can see it through the wall.

42
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:13,764
I can see his face.

43
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,836
I hope I never see that face...

44
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:24,524
...in real life.

45
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,156
That's all.

46
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,876
So...

47
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,923
...you came to see if he's out there.

48
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,243
to get rid of
of this horrible feeling.

49
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,484
Very good.

50
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,404
He is around the corner.

51
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:53,243
ENTRANCE

52
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:48,242
Dan, are you okay?

53
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,121
hello?

54
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:21,402
The girl has not yet appeared.

55
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,072
Tell me.

56
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:44,162
Everything remains the same.

57
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:22,681
I can't believe it.

58
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,752
WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES

59
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:54,872
Well, it's time to say goodbye, Betty.

60
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,791
It was a pleasure traveling with you.

61
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:00,192
Thank you, Irene.
I was very excited and nervous.

62
00:18:00,193 --> 00:18:01,793
It was great to talk.

63
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,193
I will be waiting to see you
in the films.

64
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:07,712
Good, Irene.
That day will be wonderful.

65
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,792
Good luck, dear Betty.

66
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:13,471
And take care of yourself.
Be careful.

67
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,751
I will do it. thanks again.

68
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,152
Very good, pretty.

69
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:20,072
Betty, it was a pleasure meeting you.
And very good luck.

70
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:22,040
Thank you.

71
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,153
My suitcases!

72
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,841
Where?

73
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,040
Hayvenhurst No. 1612.

74
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,280
Good.

75
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,072
MANAGER

76
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,191
I bet 10 dollars
because you're Betty.

77
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,831
Yes, I'm Betty, Mrs. Lenoix.

78
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,750
It's Mrs. Lenoix, right?

79
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:04,199
Yes, in all my splendor, pretty.

80
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,391
- Nice to meet you.
- Tell me Coco.

81
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:10,438
Like everyone.
Wait here, I'll go get the key.

82
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,679
Good, Coco.

83
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:23,471
Yes that damn dog
It is done in the patio once again...

84
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,831
...I'm going to bake it for breakfast.

85
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:29,151
- You don't have animals, do you?
- No.

86
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:32,510
You can have them.
But this is why they shouldn't be here.

87
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,030
Do you know?
A man once lived here...

88
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:37,671
...who had a boxing kangaroo.

89
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:39,951
Well, you wouldn't believe...

90
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:43,831
...what that kangaroo
did to this patio.

91
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:46,831
Let's go see the apartment
from your aunt It's nice.

92
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,957
I'm dying to see it.

93
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,478
It's incredible!

94
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:01,150
- I told you.
- Wow!

95
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:05,189
Surely you and your aunt have
an agreement, so here is the key.

96
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,870
And if you need anything,
scream.

97
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,230
Everyone in this building
They are decent people...

98
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,790
...or they wouldn't be here.

99
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,070
If you like,
I can introduce them to you later.

100
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:19,919
Well it doesn't matter
if you don't want to know them.

101
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,668
Wow. I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth
He didn't tell me there would be someone here.

102
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,948
- Very sorry.
- Don't worry.

103
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:51,148
I am Ruth's niece.
My name is Betty.

104
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:53,997
He probably told you that I would come.

105
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,669
There was an accident.

106
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,749
I came here.

107
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,308
I understand.
I saw the dress.

108
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,988
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

109
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:07,118
What happened?

110
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:10,628
A...

111
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:12,918
...a car accident.

112
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,797
Are you okay?

113
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,149
I think so.

114
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,589
I was just...

115
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,508
...taking a shower.

116
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,428
Oh my God. I'm sorry.

117
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,837
I'll let you finish.
I'm going to unpack.

118
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,157
What is your name?

119
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:44,797
Sorry. I will get out of here
and we can talk later.

120
00:23:59,288 --> 00:24:02,588
RITA HAYWORTH
IN THE ROLE OF GILDA

121
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:23,388
My name is Rita.

122
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:24,957
Hello.

123
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:28,867
Do you work with my aunt?

124
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,389
- No, I...
- Sorry.

125
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,116
It's not my business.

126
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,348
She has very pretty red hair.

127
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,587
I will stay
while working on a film...

128
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,507
...what they do in Canada.

129
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:46,997
I guess you already know that.

130
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:50,427
It would never reach me
to have a place like this.

131
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:54,347
Of course, unless they discovered me
and I became a movie star.

132
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:57,507
I would prefer to be a great actress
to a star

133
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,827
But sometimes,
people are both.

134
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:04,397
...you could say that's why
why I came here.

135
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:11,268
Sorry.
It's just that I'm very excited to be here.

136
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,747
I mean I just got here
from Deep River, Ontario...

137
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,995
...and now I'm in this...

138
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,348
...dream place.

139
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,755
You can imagine how I feel.

140
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:29,915
What...?
Sit down.

141
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:36,116
Where did you get hurt?

142
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:40,347
We should call a doctor.

143
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:43,027
- But it could be serious.
- No, I...

144
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:44,786
...I need to sleep.

145
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,986
If you suffered a concussion,
You must not sleep.

146
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,668
Nothing will happen to me if I sleep.

147
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,195
I just need to lie down and sleep.

148
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:12,988
HAVE FUN
WITH LOVE, YOUR AUNT RUTH

149
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:45,947
RYAN ENTERTAINMENT

150
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,907
You see, Adam,
There are some suggestions...

151
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:54,026
...what needs to be done.

152
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:57,066
And I know what you said
that you would consider them.

153
00:26:57,067 --> 00:27:00,435
It's what all of us here ask of you.

154
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,306
What are you talking about?

155
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:05,827
Keep an open mind.

156
00:27:05,828 --> 00:27:08,987
You are in the process
to change your main actress...

157
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:10,907
...me too...

158
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:15,155
We ask that you maintain
open mind

159
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,194
Which one did we give him last time?

160
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,226
Let's try the next one.

161
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:34,665
He won't like it.

162
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,434
We'll see.

163
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,106
The Castigliane brothers.

164
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:47,195
Let me make the introductions.

165
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:51,705
Please sit down.

166
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:53,906
This is Mr. Darby,
who they already know.

167
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:57,424
This is Adam Kesher,
the director

168
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,794
And this is Robert Smith, your agent.

169
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,226
Oh yes.

170
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,313
It is very beautiful.

171
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:41,154
Can I offer you something to drink?

172
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:45,625
- Express Coffee.
- Nothing.

173
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:49,194
- What is the photo for?
- An Express coffee.

174
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,744
No, that's all.

175
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:54,945
I think this time
You will like the Express.

176
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:58,545
I did a little research, since yes
how difficult it is to please him.

177
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,105
This one comes highly recommended.

178
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,354
What is the photo for?

179
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:06,265
It is a recommendation.

180
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,193
A recommendation for you, Adam...

181
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:13,635
- It is not a recommendation.
- She's the girl.

182
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:17,824
Which girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

183
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:21,553
We will put it on the list
of which we will consider.

184
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:26,834
You will be pleased to know that this paper
has attracted a lot of interest.

185
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,824
Interest? No no.

186
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:31,953
Six of the best actresses want it.

187
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,105
She is the girl.

188
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,144
- Ryan, take care of this.
- Wait, Adam.

189
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:39,063
What do you expect?

190
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:41,634
By no means.
No way!

191
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:58,744
A napkin.

192
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:02,064
- How do you say?
- A napkin.

193
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,664
Of course.

194
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:06,753
With permission.

195
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:24,632
Is that all, sir?

196
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:20,223
Shit.

197
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:22,783
I'm sorry.
They highly recommended it...

198
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:25,184
"It's the best Express coffee."
in the world!

199
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,782
What's happening?
That girl won't appear in my film.

200
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:31,353
Help me!

201
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,784
She is the girl.

202
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:37,352
That girl
It won't appear in my film!

203
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:42,391
It's not your film anymore.

204
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:49,073
She is the girl.

205
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:28,312
 �The limousine
Is it from the Castigliane brothers?

206
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,901
- Two men in dark suits?
- Yes.

207
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:34,671
- Yes.
- Leave the door open.

208
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:46,262
Are you waiting for the Castigliane brothers?

209
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:48,351
Go away, friend.

210
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,870
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

211
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:38,902
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

212
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:42,071
The director doesn't want her.

213
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,709
Do you want it replaced?

214
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,910
I know they said...

215
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:55,270
So?

216
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,830
So...

217
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,510
...that means we should...

218
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,270
Yes?

219
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:08,782
...cancel everything.

220
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,790
Is that something that...?

221
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,621
 �You want...

222
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,750
...let's cancel everything?

223
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,631
So, we'll cancel it.

224
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:56,062
Wow.
That's unusual.

225
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:59,310
An accident like this...
Who could have foreseen it?

226
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:03,301
- Wow!
- It's incredible, isn't it?

227
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:05,939
Damn, yes.

228
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,229
Incredible, man.

229
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:16,701
Wow, brother, you look good.

230
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:18,621
What have you done?

231
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:21,940
Well, you know, I do some things
for this subject.

232
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:24,150
Yes? Is what you earn enough for you?

233
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:27,190
Barely.

234
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:30,100
I know.

235
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,189
Look at this place.

236
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:34,869
They are few hard times.

237
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,388
Hey man,
It's not that bad.

238
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,421
I hope you don't get into trouble.

239
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:44,380
Exactly, man.

240
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:46,300
But what I told you
It made you laugh.

241
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:49,869
- It was very funny.
- A car accident.

242
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,181
Hey, that's it, right?

243
00:35:56,182 --> 00:35:58,670
It's Ed's famous black directory.

244
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:05,349
The history of the world
in telephone numbers.

245
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:36,588
Wow.

246
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,261
MORE HEALTH
ENZYMES

247
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,588
Something stung me!

248
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,987
God!

249
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,180
Hey!

250
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:43,987
She's hurt! could you come
and make a call? I need you!

251
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,427
She is seriously injured!
Come and call the hospital!

252
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,218
Come on!
I'm serious!

253
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,947
I can't do everything by myself!

254
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,667
Let me go!

255
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,188
Hello.

256
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,947
Oh, man.

257
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,737
Well, Aunt Ruth, I'll try.

258
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:19,779
I will study those parliaments
until I know them by heart.

259
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,858
I will do it here
on this fabulous leather sofa...

260
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,778
...or on the patio, while I drink coffee...

261
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,538
...like a movie star.

262
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,977
I was surprised to find here
to your friend Rita.

263
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:33,186
She was in the shower
and opened the door.

264
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,298
What do you mean?

265
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:41,457
Well, he had an accident.

266
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,266
Rita, your friend.

267
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:48,105
No, Coco opened the door.

268
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:50,987
No, he didn't see her.

269
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,546
She is asleep.

270
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:57,298
There must be an explanation.

271
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:59,707
I don't think it's necessary to do that.

272
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:05,747
Please be careful.
Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police.

273
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:20,066
You're awake.

274
00:40:24,178 --> 00:40:26,097
I think I misunderstood you.

275
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:29,617
I thought you knew my aunt
and that's why you were here.

276
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:33,345
I just talked to her
and he wants me to call the police.

277
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:46,777
I'm sorry.

278
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,905
What's wrong, Rita?

279
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,738
I thought that when I woke up...

280
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:57,456
I thought sleeping would help me.

281
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,025
What's happening?

282
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:03,816
I don't know who I am.

283
00:41:03,817 --> 00:41:05,936
What do you mean?
You are Rita.

284
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:10,097
No, I'm not Rita.
I don't know what my name is.

285
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:13,145
I don't know who I am.

286
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:26,786
This is your bag.
Your name should be on your bag.

287
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,866
You want to know, don't you?

288
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:34,024
Yes.

289
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:59,297
PINK'S HOT DOGS

290
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:08,695
- Don't you want anything?
- Not here. No, thanks.

291
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:11,455
- Anything to drink?
- No.

292
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,136
Thank you.

293
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:15,984
I would like a cigarette,
if you have one.

294
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:21,264
Yes, they are in the pocket
of my shirt.

295
00:43:25,776 --> 00:43:28,105
Are there new girls on the street?

296
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,263
I haven't seen any.

297
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:37,615
A brunette?

298
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:39,703
Maybe a little beat up.

299
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:48,295
Keep your eyes open,
yes, baby?

300
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:51,663
- Clear.
- Yes, of course you will.

301
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:56,423
"You don't know...

302
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:01,824
...where did that money come from?

303
00:44:03,536 --> 00:44:07,944
When you think about money
and in the key...

304
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:12,623
...do you remember something?

305
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,903
There is something...

306
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:20,943
There is something there.

307
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,255
What did you say?

308
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:36,335
They fired everyone.

309
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:38,535
Who fired everyone?

310
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:42,734
Ray, Wait!
I'm talking on the phone...

311
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:45,776
And then they closed the set,
They all left.

312
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:47,864
You better come, Adam.

313
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:53,054
You should talk to Ray,
You must fix this.

314
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:54,694
I'll go home.

315
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,174
Home?

316
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,093
Come to the office,
We must do something.

317
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,013
You have to do something, Adam.

318
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:02,095
I'll go home, Cynthia.

319
00:45:02,096 --> 00:45:04,095
Adam, listen to me,
You are not like that.

320
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:05,694
Come to the office.

321
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:08,462
- We can do something,
- I'll go home.

322
00:45:18,856 --> 00:45:21,303
I wonder where you were going.

323
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:28,062
To Mulholland Drive.

324
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:34,662
To Mulholland Drive?

325
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:38,734
That's where I was heading:

326
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,942
...to Mulholland Drive.

327
00:45:42,815 --> 00:45:45,542
Maybe that's where the accident was.

328
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:49,263
There must be a police report.
We could call...

329
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:52,093
...anonymously,
from a public telephone...

330
00:45:52,094 --> 00:45:55,134
...to see if there was an accident.

331
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:57,694
Come on. It will be like in the movies.

332
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:00,622
We will pretend to be someone else.

333
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:03,734
In any case,
I want to go for a walk.

334
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:07,053
I'm in Hollywood
and I haven't seen it yet.

335
00:46:07,054 --> 00:46:10,142
Come on, Rita.
Do you think you can?

336
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:21,223
But just...

337
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:25,333
...just to see.

338
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:29,413
just to see
If there was an accident...

339
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:32,021
...on Mulholland Drive.

340
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,694
GENE CLEANING

341
00:47:12,654 --> 00:47:14,742
Lorraine?

342
00:47:15,534 --> 00:47:17,661
Lorraine, are you home?

343
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,821
Now I know that you have done well.

344
00:47:45,734 --> 00:47:49,220
Forget you saw this.
It's better this way.

345
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,782
And what the hell are you doing here?

346
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:08,701
What are you doing?

347
00:48:11,253 --> 00:48:12,901
They are my jewelry!

348
00:48:29,293 --> 00:48:32,612
That unfortunate man!
Unhappy!

349
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:34,940
He's probably upset, Lorraine.

350
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:43,100
What are you doing?

351
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,531
Enough! Enough!

352
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,731
Adam, stop it!

353
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:52,971
Enough! Enough!

354
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,020
Adam, stop it!

355
00:48:57,293 --> 00:49:01,621
You hurt me! Gene!
You hurt me!

356
00:49:05,772 --> 00:49:08,940
Don't treat your wife like that.
It doesn't matter what you've done.

357
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:11,701
Say it!

358
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:18,741
Damn Adam!

359
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:27,180
Get away!

360
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:06,780
Let's hide it.

361
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:43,540
ENTRANCE

362
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:52,058
There's one.

363
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,930
Hollywood Police.

364
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:12,530
I want information about an accident
on Mulholland Drive, last night.

365
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,060
Please wait
I will contact Traffic.

366
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:20,338
- Sergeant Baxter.
- Hello. I want to know...

367
00:51:21,731 --> 00:51:25,330
I heard a noise last night that sounds
like a car had crashed...

368
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:29,289
...and, well, I want to know if there was
an accident on Mulholland Drive.

369
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,210
Yes, there was.

370
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:34,210
- Can you tell me what happened?
- Can't.

371
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:37,139
- Were there any injuries?
- Can I have your name, please?

372
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,771
There was an accident.

373
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,730
He didn't tell me anything else,
but it was your accident.

374
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,858
I know it was.

375
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:53,611
Maybe they reported something
in the newspapers.

376
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,019
Come on. We'll drink a coffee and see.

377
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:03,369
Maybe it happened so late
that didn't appear in today's newspaper.

378
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,498
Is there nothing?

379
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,378
Nothing I can see.

380
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,178
Don't worry.

381
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:20,698
Thank you, Diane.

382
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:28,489
Is that all?
Do you want your account?

383
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,498
Rita, do you want something?

384
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:37,457
- No, just the coffee.
- Leave us the bill.

385
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,377
What's wrong, Rita?

386
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:55,978
I remember something.

387
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:04,650
- What?
-Diane Selwyn.

388
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:07,258
Maybe that's my name.

389
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:16,087
"D. Selwyn."
He is the only one.

390
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:18,217
I'm going to call.

391
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,208
It's strange that you call yourself.

392
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:29,338
Maybe it's not my house.

393
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,449
Hello, it's me.

394
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,497
Leave a message.

395
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,057
It's not my voice.

396
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:48,937
But I know her.

397
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,968
Maybe it's not Diane Selwyn's voice.

398
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:56,168
Maybe he lives with you.

399
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:58,528
Or if it's Diane Selwyn...

400
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:00,897
...could tell you who you are.

401
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:05,937
Maybe.
Maybe. Maybe.

402
00:54:44,808 --> 00:54:47,528
- Yes, exactly. Get away!
- It's Adam Kesher's house.

403
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:49,247
Of course not.
Go now!

404
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:51,016
Long!

405
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:02,857
Out of here he never
I will return, never.

406
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,647
I think you don't understand.
He said go away!

407
00:55:07,648 --> 00:55:09,097
I'll show you the door!

408
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,296
Get out!

409
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:44,568
-Yes? What's up, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

410
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:48,487
...but there seems to be a problem
with your credit cards.

411
00:55:48,488 --> 00:55:51,374
What? I will pay you in cash.

412
00:55:54,528 --> 00:55:57,256
Two men from his bank came.

413
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,495
From my bank?

414
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:03,135
-How did you know I was here?
- I don't know.

415
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:05,807
What did they say?

416
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:10,167
They told me to let you know
that reached the top of its limit...

417
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:13,576
...and that your line of credit
was cancelled.

418
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:17,015
That's incredible.

419
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,256
Well, look...

420
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:24,615
...I don't know what's happening.

421
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,576
Those are pure lies.

422
00:56:29,726 --> 00:56:31,926
I have enough cash for you.

423
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:34,166
Oh, I know.

424
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:36,127
Don't worry.

425
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:38,886
But, I'm sorry.

426
00:56:38,887 --> 00:56:40,975
It was my duty to inform him.

427
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:48,815
The people he hides from
They know where it is.

428
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:51,936
Clear.

429
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:54,975
I'm sorry.

430
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:18,766
hello?

431
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:20,726
I think someone froze my money.

432
00:57:20,727 --> 00:57:22,646
I know.
Where are you, Adam?

433
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,846
Sorry.
How do you know?

434
00:57:24,847 --> 00:57:26,766
Someone called.
Since you weren't...

435
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:29,087
...told me that you were broke.

436
00:57:29,088 --> 00:57:31,287
I didn't believe him and made some calls.

437
00:57:31,288 --> 00:57:33,606
- And?
- You're broke.

438
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:35,166
Of course not!

439
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:38,055
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

440
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:41,925
At Cookie's hotel, downtown.

441
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:45,696
Do you know someone
called the "Cowboy"?

442
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:48,685
-The Cowboy?
- Yes...

443
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:50,325
...the Cowboy.

444
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:53,325
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you

445
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,854
Jason said he thought it was a good idea.

446
00:57:57,326 --> 00:58:00,486
Jason thinks it's a good idea.
Let him go see the Cowboy.

447
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:03,725
I must wear my hat
and my revolvers?

448
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:07,454
I have a feeling that this man
It is related to what happens.

449
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:12,045
I think you should do it, and I think
that you should do it immediately.

450
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:13,966
What's wrong, Cynthia?

451
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:16,535
It's been a very strange day.

452
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:20,174
And it gets weirder.

453
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:25,575
Where do I see this Cowboy?
Should I go look for him in the field?

454
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:28,404
More or less, clown.

455
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,406
If I tell him that you agreed to see him...

456
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:33,166
...you will have to go to the top
from Beachwood Canyon...

457
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:37,085
...and it will be waiting for you
in a corral there.

458
00:58:37,086 --> 00:58:39,685
You must be kidding.

459
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:42,004
Will you go see it?

460
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:44,204
Yes. Clear.

461
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:47,445
It has been a very strange day.
When?

462
00:58:47,446 --> 00:58:49,526
I'll call you right away...

463
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:52,165
...and I will call you again.

464
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:56,334
You could stay at my house if you want.

465
00:58:57,127 --> 00:58:59,244
I don't think it's a good idea.

466
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,486
He only offered you asylum.

467
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:04,646
Yes, and I appreciate the offer.
I will find a place.

468
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:07,965
Look, just give him a shout
to that Cowboy and call me.

469
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:11,565
Good. but you don't know
of what you're missing.

470
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:14,973
Do your thing, little one, and call me.

471
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,525
It's this way: Sierra Bonita.

472
00:59:28,526 --> 00:59:30,653
It's not very far.

473
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,574
What's wrong with it?

474
00:59:34,406 --> 00:59:36,534
I don't know if we should do it.

475
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:40,413
I know something scares you.

476
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,814
We'll be careful, I promise.

477
00:59:45,044 --> 00:59:48,605
Tomorrow we will go there...

478
00:59:48,606 --> 00:59:50,814
...and we will investigate.

479
01:00:03,285 --> 01:00:05,054
Everything will be fine.

480
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:09,693
It's probably Coco.

481
01:00:12,765 --> 01:00:14,205
Yes?

482
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:15,564
Can I help you?

483
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:17,852
Someone is in trouble.

484
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,165
Who are you?

485
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,963
What are you doing at Ruth's apartment?

486
01:00:24,964 --> 01:00:27,043
She allowed me to stay here.

487
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:29,604
I am your niece.
My name is Betty.

488
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:31,323
No.

489
01:00:31,324 --> 01:00:33,883
That's not what she said.

490
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:38,444
Someone is in trouble.
Something bad is happening!

491
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:41,884
Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't know who you are and...

492
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:44,973
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

493
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:50,404
I've been looking for you
from 3:00 in the afternoon.

494
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:53,685
She is in my room
and he doesn't want to leave.

495
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:57,444
I want you to take it out.
I want you to take it out now.

496
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,164
This is Louise Bonner.
His intentions are good.

497
01:01:00,165 --> 01:01:04,163
Louise, this is Betty.
She is Ruth's niece.

498
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:07,164
Fortunately,
I was coming to see Betty.

499
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:09,844
Betty is a young actress
and I came to deliver...

500
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:13,123
...some pages I received by fax
for your audition tomorrow.

501
01:01:13,124 --> 01:01:15,844
- Well, here you are, pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

502
01:01:15,845 --> 01:01:18,403
Come on, Louise.
I'll take you home.

503
01:01:18,404 --> 01:01:21,243
I'm sorry. Sometimes this happens.
Come on.

504
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,724
No. She said someone else
I had problems.

505
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:26,763
Enough, Louise.
I'll take you home.

506
01:01:26,764 --> 01:01:28,763
Come on.

507
01:01:28,764 --> 01:01:31,483
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

508
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:33,252
Good night.

509
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:44,892
Wow.

510
01:02:10,885 --> 01:02:12,531
Cowboy.

511
01:03:17,963 --> 01:03:20,771
- Hello.
- Hello.

512
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:24,491
It's a beautiful night.

513
01:03:28,564 --> 01:03:31,042
Thank you for coming to see me
until now...

514
01:03:31,043 --> 01:03:34,331
...from that nice hotel downtown.

515
01:03:35,523 --> 01:03:38,601
You are welcome.
What do you want to talk about?

516
01:03:38,602 --> 01:03:42,011
Damn, you're a man
who likes to get to the point.

517
01:03:43,003 --> 01:03:45,761
You need to get to the point, right?

518
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:47,370
As you say.

519
01:03:49,003 --> 01:03:51,602
The attitude of a man...

520
01:03:51,603 --> 01:03:54,361
The attitude of a man
It has a lot to do...

521
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:57,121
...with the way your life will be.

522
01:03:57,122 --> 01:03:59,811
Does that seem true to you?

523
01:04:00,323 --> 01:04:02,121
Clear.

524
01:04:02,122 --> 01:04:05,882
Now, you answered because
You thought that's what I wanted to hear...

525
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,082
...or did you consider what I said...

526
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:12,090
...and you answered why really?
do you think it's true?

527
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:17,209
I agree with what you said.
Actually.

528
01:04:18,642 --> 01:04:20,769
What did I say?

529
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:27,050
That a man's attitude determines,
in large part, what your life will be like.

530
01:04:28,362 --> 01:04:30,922
Since you agree...

531
01:04:30,923 --> 01:04:35,802
...you must be a person
who doesn't care about the good life.

532
01:04:35,803 --> 01:04:38,171
Why?

533
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:43,361
Well, think about it for a moment.

534
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:45,771
Would you do that for me?

535
01:04:47,803 --> 01:04:50,970
Well, I'm thinking about it.

536
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,040
No, you're not thinking.

537
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:59,168
You're too busy being a know-it-all
like to think.

538
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:04,441
Now I want you to think
and stop acting like a know-it-all.

539
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,761
Could you try it?

540
01:05:06,762 --> 01:05:10,890
Look, what are you trying to get at with this?
What do you want me to do?

541
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:13,920
There are motorized strollers.

542
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:16,490
How many drivers
Do you have one of those?

543
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:19,081
One.

544
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:22,241
So let's say
I drive this stroller...

545
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:25,610
...and if you improve your attitude,
You can get on with me.

546
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:28,520
Good.

547
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:31,610
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

548
01:05:32,403 --> 01:05:34,840
Anyway,
You were looking for a leading actress.

549
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:38,840
Audition lots of girls
for that role.

550
01:05:38,841 --> 01:05:43,680
When you see the girl
that they showed you this morning, you will say:

551
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:46,921
"She's the girl."

552
01:05:46,922 --> 01:05:49,401
The rest of the cast
can stay the same.

553
01:05:49,402 --> 01:05:52,000
You can decide that.

554
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:55,009
But you can't choose
to the main actress.

555
01:05:56,722 --> 01:05:59,520
Now,
you will see me once more...

556
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:02,081
...if you do things right.

557
01:06:02,082 --> 01:06:05,082
You will see me twice more...

558
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:07,401
...if you do things wrong.

559
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:09,209
Good night.

560
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:34,881
Are you still here?

561
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:37,639
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

562
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,769
Nobody wants you here.

563
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:42,200
Really?

564
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:44,799
My parents are upstairs.
They think you left.

565
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,880
- And? Surprise!
- I can call them. Call my father.

566
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:51,041
But you won't.

567
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:54,279
If you try to blackmail me,
It won't work.

568
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,279
You are playing a dangerous game.

569
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,600
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

570
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:02,079
Go!
Go before I call my dad!

571
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,160
He trusts you.
You are his best friend.

572
01:07:05,161 --> 01:07:07,600
Everything will end here.

573
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:10,760
And you?
What will your father think of you?

574
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,728
Enough! That's what you said
from the beginning!

575
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:18,199
If I tell what happened,
They will arrest you and imprison you.

576
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,120
So go before...

577
01:07:22,326 --> 01:07:23,349
Before what?

578
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:26,782
Before I kill you.

579
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,289
Then, they will put you in jail.

580
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,959
And then I cry, cry and cry,
and I say very emotionally:

581
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,848
"I hate you!
"I hate us both!"

582
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,319
What a bad scene.

583
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,528
But you act very well.

584
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,287
Thanks, darling.

585
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,999
Hello.

586
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,808
Who are you?

587
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,527
Betty, can I talk to you outside?

588
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,767
- What's wrong, Coco?
- Your aunt called.

589
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,599
That's what I feared.

590
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,168
He wants to know who is
in his apartment.

591
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:46,476
Will stay a couple of nights
until I find another place.

592
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:48,877
I tried to tell my aunt,
but he couldn't hear me well...

593
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:51,835
...and his plane was about to leave.
She got confused.

594
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,996
I told him that Rita was a friend of mine...

595
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:56,605
...and she said she didn't know
to no Rita.

596
01:08:57,636 --> 01:08:59,675
Look me in the eyes, darling.

597
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:01,756
It's very decent.

598
01:09:01,757 --> 01:09:03,516
Linda, you are a good girl.

599
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:06,795
But you're telling me
pure lies...

600
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:09,556
...even if you say them from the heart.

601
01:09:09,557 --> 01:09:12,285
Now, trust
How will you solve this?

602
01:09:12,797 --> 01:09:16,356
- Thank you.
- Don't make me look stupid.

603
01:09:16,357 --> 01:09:18,636
Louise Bonner said
that there were difficulties.

604
01:09:18,637 --> 01:09:20,555
Do you remember last night?

605
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:24,036
Well, sometimes he's wrong.

606
01:09:24,037 --> 01:09:27,886
But if there are difficulties,
get rid of them.

607
01:09:37,476 --> 01:09:39,554
Is everything in order?

608
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:41,436
Does it hurt you that I'm here?

609
01:09:41,437 --> 01:09:44,675
No no.
Everything is perfect.

610
01:09:44,676 --> 01:09:46,835
Now, I'll go do
that sandwich.

611
01:09:46,836 --> 01:09:49,924
And my hearing
It's in an hour!

612
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:11,675
I hope to return
in a couple of hours.

613
01:10:11,676 --> 01:10:14,715
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck!

614
01:10:14,716 --> 01:10:17,915
When I return, I will leave the taxi
expecting. You must be ready.

615
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:20,004
- Good.
- Okay?

616
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:48,842
Voila...

617
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:52,434
Betty Elms, meet you...

618
01:10:52,435 --> 01:10:54,723
...to Jack Tuptman, my assistant.

619
01:10:55,475 --> 01:10:57,274
Woody Katz, who will play the role...

620
01:10:57,275 --> 01:10:59,924
...of Chucky will represent
this scene with you.

621
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:03,195
Bob Brooker, the director.

622
01:11:03,196 --> 01:11:05,874
And Julie Chadwick.

623
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,314
And our surprise guest:

624
01:11:08,315 --> 01:11:10,514
Lynne James.

625
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:12,754
It's not enough for us
to hire her...

626
01:11:12,755 --> 01:11:15,515
...but, she is the best...

627
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:18,115
...delivery agent that exists.

628
01:11:18,116 --> 01:11:21,115
Well, thanks, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

629
01:11:21,116 --> 01:11:22,995
It's a pleasure.

630
01:11:22,996 --> 01:11:25,362
This is Nikki, my assistant.

631
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:29,034
And the lovely Martha.

632
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,563
Martha Johnson,
the one who received you.

633
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:34,402
Hello.

634
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:38,482
Shall we try it?

635
01:11:39,635 --> 01:11:43,234
Do you want water or coffee?
before starting?

636
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:45,155
No, I'm fine like that.

637
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:48,763
So everyone sit down.

638
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:56,123
Why don't you go over to Woody?
and they interpret the scene?

639
01:11:57,554 --> 01:12:00,315
Bob, do you want to say something?

640
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,315
Do you want to say something to Betty?
before starting?

641
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:06,122
No. It is not a contest.

642
01:12:07,274 --> 01:12:11,322
The two... one with the other.

643
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:16,514
So don't act emotional...

644
01:12:16,515 --> 01:12:19,603
...until it's something emotional.

645
01:12:24,355 --> 01:12:26,353
Good.

646
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,873
Tell me where it hurts.

647
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:29,993
What?

648
01:12:29,994 --> 01:12:32,154
Bobby, I want to act
very close to her...

649
01:12:32,155 --> 01:12:34,034
...like I did with that girl...

650
01:12:34,035 --> 01:12:36,714
What is it called? The one with the black hair.
It turned out very well.

651
01:12:36,715 --> 01:12:38,394
- What do you think?
- Very good.

652
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,834
But don't rush
with that parliament.

653
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:44,561
I already told you, it's where you say:
"Before what?"

654
01:12:45,353 --> 01:12:48,033
Bobby, acting is reaction.

655
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:51,513
I only react to your parliament.
They all say:

656
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,393
"They will arrest you." With that tone.

657
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:55,433
"And they will imprison you."
They all say it like that.

658
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:57,793
When they say it, I react.

659
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,952
What is your name?
Yes, Betty.

660
01:12:59,953 --> 01:13:04,514
Look, if you don't rush,
I won't rush, okay?

661
01:13:04,515 --> 01:13:07,393
Now, we will act this scene
very together...

662
01:13:07,394 --> 01:13:10,442
...just like in the movies, okay?

663
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:14,762
Dad's best friend comes into action.

664
01:13:20,315 --> 01:13:23,361
And action!

665
01:13:27,994 --> 01:13:30,121
Are you still here?

666
01:13:31,313 --> 01:13:34,833
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

667
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:37,992
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

668
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:42,233
My parents are upstairs.
They think you left.

669
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:44,473
And?
Surprise!

670
01:13:44,474 --> 01:13:47,793
I can call them.
I can call my dad.

671
01:13:47,794 --> 01:13:49,562
But you won't.

672
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:07,402
You are playing a dangerous game.

673
01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:11,752
If you try to blackmail me...

674
01:14:11,753 --> 01:14:13,921
...will not work.

675
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:17,912
You know what I want.

676
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:20,041
It's not that difficult.

677
01:14:22,714 --> 01:14:24,481
Go away.

678
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:29,552
Go before I call my dad.

679
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,793
He trusts you.

680
01:14:31,794 --> 01:14:33,912
Are you...

681
01:14:33,912 --> 01:14:35,720
...his best friend.

682
01:14:39,554 --> 01:14:42,160
Everything will end here.

683
01:14:44,472 --> 01:14:48,471
And you?
What will your father think of you?

684
01:14:48,472 --> 01:14:51,071
That's enough.

685
01:14:51,072 --> 01:14:52,841
Enough.

686
01:14:54,393 --> 01:14:56,521
That's what you said
from the beginning.

687
01:14:58,472 --> 01:15:00,952
If I tell what happened,
they will arrest you...

688
01:15:00,953 --> 01:15:03,041
...and they will imprison you.

689
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:11,792
So go...

690
01:15:11,793 --> 01:15:13,401
...before...

691
01:15:16,633 --> 01:15:18,441
Before what?

692
01:15:36,112 --> 01:15:38,632
Before...

693
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:40,801
...of killing you.

694
01:15:55,193 --> 01:15:57,361
Then, they will put you in jail.

695
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:07,799
I hate you.

696
01:16:09,432 --> 01:16:11,520
I hate us both.

697
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:29,520
- I'm going to take her there.
- Yes, I think so.

698
01:16:33,312 --> 01:16:36,111
Well, there you have it.

699
01:16:36,112 --> 01:16:38,469
Yes, of course.

700
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,440
Baby, you're great.
Oh really.

701
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:47,550
Very good. Actually.

702
01:16:47,551 --> 01:16:50,151
I mean, it was forced, maybe...

703
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:54,070
...but humanistic.

704
01:16:54,071 --> 01:16:55,030
Yes.

705
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:56,952
Very good.

706
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:59,680
Oh really. Oh really.

707
01:17:05,432 --> 01:17:08,030
Oh, thank you, Betty...

708
01:17:08,031 --> 01:17:10,630
...and I say that with all sincerity.

709
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,680
I mean, it was extraordinary.

710
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:16,390
Your aunt will be proud of you.

711
01:17:16,391 --> 01:17:20,430
I'll tell you as soon as I have the chance.

712
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:22,830
Now, you and me...

713
01:17:22,831 --> 01:17:24,750
...we will talk again very soon.

714
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,029
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

715
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,950
Thanks, Wally.

716
01:17:28,951 --> 01:17:32,190
I know you have a lot to talk about.
We'll walk her outside.

717
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:36,031
Yes, of course.
It was a pleasure, Lynne.

718
01:17:36,032 --> 01:17:38,550
Don't forget to come visit us.

719
01:17:38,551 --> 01:17:41,590
- We would love for you to come.
- Come, Betty.

720
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:43,351
Thanks again, Mr. Brown.

721
01:17:43,352 --> 01:17:46,359
It was a pleasure to meet you.

722
01:17:53,672 --> 01:17:56,549
- Wow!
- It's more than wonderful.

723
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:58,470
Where the hell did you find it?

724
01:17:58,471 --> 01:18:00,599
God, that was horrible.

725
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:04,589
Not you, Betty.
Your performance was stellar.

726
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,389
But poor Wally.

727
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,470
I will never be able to make that movie.

728
01:18:08,471 --> 01:18:10,749
Wally's career
It ended 20 years ago.

729
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,829
Woody Katz just does it
as a favor

730
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,951
And they say the cast is terrible.

731
01:18:15,952 --> 01:18:17,990
Oh, God, terrible.

732
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:20,270
Poor Wally, you old fool.

733
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:24,110
He was very kind,
and it seemed very tender to me.

734
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:27,029
And Wally... Mr. Brown,
He is a very good friend of my aunt and...

735
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:29,911
Calm. Don't get me wrong.
I love Wally.

736
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:33,469
It's normal, I was married to him
for ten years.

737
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:36,429
And I love actors,
to all the actors.

738
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:39,629
It's just that sometimes
we are malicious

739
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,269
We will take you to introduce yourself
to a director...

740
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,108
...who is above everyone.

741
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:47,030
have a project
that will leave you speechless.

742
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:49,197
Stupid!

743
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,390
Sixteen reasons

744
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:56,029
why

745
01:18:56,030 --> 01:19:00,629

746
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:03,830

- Four

750
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:16,310
They are all part

751
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:18,989
Of the sixteen reasons

752
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:24,398
for which I love you

753
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,588
- Five
- The way you comb your hair

754
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:31,789

755
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:34,910

756
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:38,709
- Eight
- Your crazy clothes

757
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:43,709
those are only half
of the sixteen reasons

758
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,828
why

759
01:19:45,829 --> 01:19:49,359
I love you

760
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:52,948
- Nine
- You hug me in the car

761
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:56,668
- Ten
- You make a wish on a star

762
01:19:56,669 --> 01:19:59,827
- Eleven
- You whisper into the phone

763
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:02,708

- Sixteen

768
01:20:15,509 --> 01:20:18,188
those are all

769
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:20,949
The sixteen reasons

770
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,189
why

771
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:25,917
I love you

772
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,947
Sixteen reasons

773
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:32,907
why

774
01:20:32,908 --> 01:20:36,197
I love you

775
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:40,828
Court. Thank you very much, Carol.
I'm going there.

776
01:20:40,829 --> 01:20:43,188
Shall I check the camera?
Camera review!

777
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:45,108
Thank you!
We will let you know!

778
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:48,267
Thank you very much for coming.
I know how busy you are.

779
01:20:48,268 --> 01:20:51,268
Are you kidding? I love the script.
Just tell me where to sign.

780
01:20:51,269 --> 01:20:53,189
I would love to, but they...

781
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:55,828
...they won't let me choose
until you have seen them all.

782
01:20:55,829 --> 01:20:57,748
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.
- I know.

783
01:20:57,749 --> 01:21:01,707
My agent will bother you day and night,
okay? And me too.

784
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:03,948
- It will be a pleasure. Go away.
- How cruel you are.

785
01:21:03,949 --> 01:21:06,229
Don't forget me.
The role will be mine.

786
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,998
See you later.

787
01:21:09,588 --> 01:21:11,788
Where's Hank?

788
01:21:11,789 --> 01:21:14,156
-Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

789
01:21:15,428 --> 01:21:17,515
- Are you ready?
- List.

790
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:21,197
- Let it happen.
- Camilla Rhodes is next.

791
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:30,437
The story of Sylvia North,
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

792
01:21:31,749 --> 01:21:34,507
Well, here we go!
Close, please!

793
01:21:34,508 --> 01:21:36,908
- Sound, please!
- Sound!

794
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:39,037
Play music, and action.

795
01:21:52,148 --> 01:21:54,388
Tell me why I haven't told you

796
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:57,907
Oh baby, I told them

797
01:21:57,908 --> 01:21:59,867
To all the little stars

798
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:04,187
How tender I think you are

799
01:22:04,188 --> 01:22:08,636
Tell me why I haven't told you

800
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,228
Bring Jason.

801
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:13,675
Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

802
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:19,747
My heart is an open book

803
01:22:19,747 --> 01:22:25,196
Tell me why I haven't told you

804
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,107
My friends ask me

805
01:22:29,107 --> 01:22:30,627
What if I'm in love?

806
01:22:30,628 --> 01:22:34,707
I always answer yes

807
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:38,546
It would be better if he confessed

808
01:22:38,547 --> 01:22:42,028
If the answer is yes

809
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:46,227
Maybe you love me too

810
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:50,356
Oh, my love, if so

811
01:22:51,987 --> 01:22:54,075
...did you want to tell me something, Adam?

812
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:06,474
She is the girl.

813
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:14,314
It's an excellent choice, Adam.

814
01:23:24,306 --> 01:23:26,115
Holy shit.

815
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:37,586
I have an appointment.

816
01:23:37,587 --> 01:23:39,674
I was meeting a friend.

817
01:23:40,787 --> 01:23:43,116
I'm sorry. I must go.

818
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:10,226
It must be around here.

819
01:24:10,227 --> 01:24:12,707
2590. It's there!

820
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,386
Up there.

821
01:24:14,387 --> 01:24:16,994
- Does it seem familiar to you?
- No.

822
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:26,704
- Don't stop!
- What's wrong? What did you see?

823
01:24:26,705 --> 01:24:30,555
- To those men in the car.
- Do you know them?

824
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,466
Don't stop.

825
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,554
Go to the back.

826
01:25:14,947 --> 01:25:16,867
SIERRA BONITA APARTMENTS

827
01:25:21,506 --> 01:25:23,634
Selwyn, number 12.

828
01:25:46,186 --> 01:25:48,274
You already scared me.

829
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:15,473
See?
I told you there was nothing to fear.

830
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,672
Wait.

831
01:27:19,465 --> 01:27:21,073
No.

832
01:27:45,744 --> 01:27:47,503
There is no one at home.

833
01:27:47,504 --> 01:27:49,471
Yes?

834
01:27:55,185 --> 01:27:57,672
Number 17.

835
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:00,752
But it said number 12.

836
01:28:03,023 --> 01:28:06,393
We exchange apartments.
It's at 17.

837
01:28:06,985 --> 01:28:08,993
It's at the bottom left.

838
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:15,992
But he has been absent for several days.

839
01:28:18,663 --> 01:28:21,231
- We'll leave you a note.
- I will accompany them.

840
01:28:24,344 --> 01:28:26,472
It still has some more things.

841
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:34,151
Come forward.
I have to answer.

842
01:28:49,064 --> 01:28:51,342
I assume you're not Diane Selwyn.

843
01:28:51,343 --> 01:28:53,473
I guess not.

844
01:29:28,704 --> 01:29:30,871
Anyway, there's no one home.

845
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,782
What are you doing?

846
01:30:00,783 --> 01:30:03,622
Help me get in. Come on.

847
01:30:03,623 --> 01:30:05,711
I will open the main door.

848
01:30:12,264 --> 01:30:14,031
Come on.

849
01:32:39,421 --> 01:32:41,509
I know what you're doing.

850
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,749
I know what you have to do.

851
01:33:06,501 --> 01:33:08,628
But let me do it.

852
01:33:17,061 --> 01:33:19,189
Let me do it.

853
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,709
You look like another person.

854
01:34:04,741 --> 01:34:06,469
Good night, Betty.

855
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,098
You don't have to wear it at home.

856
01:34:09,099 --> 01:34:11,139
What?

857
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,028
The wig.

858
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,258
He was just seeing me again.

859
01:34:17,259 --> 01:34:19,138
I'll take it off to sleep.

860
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:21,500
And you don't have to sleep on that couch.

861
01:34:21,501 --> 01:34:23,658
It's comfortable.

862
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:26,699
No, of course not.
This bed is huge.

863
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,908
Come on. Come to bed and rest.

864
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,987
It's more comfortable than the sofa, isn't it?

865
01:35:03,418 --> 01:35:04,946
Yes.

866
01:35:11,779 --> 01:35:13,268
Thanks, Betty.

867
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,659
You are welcome.

868
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:18,938
I shouldn't have left you
sleeping on the couch last night.

869
01:35:18,939 --> 01:35:21,619
No, I say...

870
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:24,628
...thanks for everything.

871
01:35:27,579 --> 01:35:29,666
You are welcome.

872
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,307
Good night, baby.

873
01:35:50,699 --> 01:35:52,507
Good night.

874
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:35,186
Have you done this before?

875
01:36:36,898 --> 01:36:38,978
I don't know.

876
01:36:38,979 --> 01:36:40,788
And you?

877
01:36:53,818 --> 01:36:56,267
I want to do it with you.

878
01:37:21,299 --> 01:37:23,665
I'm in love with you.

879
01:37:37,698 --> 01:37:40,064
I'm in love with you.

880
01:38:46,978 --> 01:38:48,745
Rita, wake up.

881
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,976
Everything is fine.

882
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:57,064
No, it's not right.

883
01:38:57,856 --> 01:39:00,385
What's happening?

884
01:39:00,857 --> 01:39:02,986
Come with me.

885
01:39:04,977 --> 01:39:09,025
It's 2:00.
It's 2:00 in the morning.

886
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:13,705
Come with me.

887
01:39:14,856 --> 01:39:18,545
Clear. Now?

888
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:22,784
Right now.

889
01:40:55,896 --> 01:40:59,344
There is no band!

890
01:41:03,456 --> 01:41:06,176
All this is...

891
01:41:06,177 --> 01:41:08,664
...a recording.

892
01:41:10,176 --> 01:41:13,944
And yet, we hear a band.

893
01:41:15,256 --> 01:41:18,173
And if we want to hear a clarinet...

894
01:41:18,174 --> 01:41:19,982
...listen.

895
01:41:50,055 --> 01:41:53,624
A muted trumpet.

896
01:42:10,656 --> 01:42:13,422
Everything is recorded.

897
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:23,623
Everything is a tape.

898
01:42:36,534 --> 01:42:38,974
Is...

899
01:42:38,975 --> 01:42:41,183
...an illusion.

900
01:42:45,414 --> 01:42:47,062
Listen!

901
01:51:35,649 --> 01:51:37,457
Hi gorgeous.

902
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:41,015
It's time to wake up.

903
01:53:13,727 --> 01:53:17,327
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

904
01:53:17,328 --> 01:53:19,576
My lamp and my dishes.

905
01:53:21,847 --> 01:53:24,376
Please, Diane.
It's been three weeks.

906
01:53:26,968 --> 01:53:29,335
I put your dishes in that box.

907
01:53:49,008 --> 01:53:51,854
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

908
01:54:03,808 --> 01:54:04,967
Whenever you want.

909
01:54:04,968 --> 01:54:07,735
I make sure I don't forget anything, Diane.

910
01:54:16,886 --> 01:54:19,294
- Is this all?
- Yes.

911
01:54:24,406 --> 01:54:27,814
By the way, the two detectives
They came back to look for you.

912
01:55:19,046 --> 01:55:20,414
Stretcher.

913
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:25,774
You came back.

914
01:57:03,525 --> 01:57:06,133
What were you saying, beautiful?

915
01:57:06,924 --> 01:57:09,204
Said:

916
01:57:09,205 --> 01:57:11,333
"You drive me crazy."

917
01:57:23,764 --> 01:57:25,894
We shouldn't do this anymore.

918
01:57:32,245 --> 01:57:34,052
Don't say that.

919
01:57:39,123 --> 01:57:41,964
Never say that.

920
01:57:41,965 --> 01:57:44,045
No, Diane.

921
01:57:44,046 --> 01:57:47,092
Enough!
Diane, stop it!

922
01:57:48,005 --> 01:57:50,572
I already tried to tell you before.

923
01:57:59,126 --> 01:58:01,532
It's for him, isn't it?

924
01:58:12,244 --> 01:58:14,564
I'm not trying to show you
how to do the scene.

925
01:58:14,565 --> 01:58:17,123
But just watch me...

926
01:58:17,123 --> 01:58:19,412
...and I think you will understand
what i want to say.

927
01:58:23,844 --> 01:58:26,162
Well, you shouldn't sit so stiff.

928
01:58:26,163 --> 01:58:28,972
Just...just relax.

929
01:58:29,525 --> 01:58:31,564
Now, you are alone...

930
01:58:31,565 --> 01:58:33,812
...and they feel comfortable...

931
01:58:35,124 --> 01:58:37,843
...as if they knew each other
of all life.

932
01:58:37,844 --> 01:58:40,692
Even if they don't say anything,
They feel very comfortable.

933
01:58:42,724 --> 01:58:44,644
Hank, could you get everyone out?

934
01:58:44,645 --> 01:58:47,284
There are many people here.
Let's solve this.

935
01:58:47,285 --> 01:58:49,762
Get off the set!
Come out, please!

936
01:58:49,763 --> 01:58:51,971
Everyone go get a cup of coffee.

937
01:58:52,604 --> 01:58:55,332
- Everyone, please!
-Can Diane stay?

938
01:58:55,883 --> 01:59:00,492
Yes, of course. Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay.

939
01:59:06,324 --> 01:59:08,243
Now when I start crying...

940
01:59:08,244 --> 01:59:10,372
...don't pull her towards you.

941
01:59:11,763 --> 01:59:14,091
Let it recharge in you.

942
01:59:14,883 --> 01:59:17,012
Let it recharge.

943
01:59:20,124 --> 01:59:22,252
And when you kiss her...

944
01:59:23,604 --> 01:59:26,570
...let it be a continuation
of that movement.

945
01:59:28,482 --> 01:59:30,211
There is no pause.

946
01:59:54,923 --> 01:59:56,692
Turn off the lights!

947
02:00:06,322 --> 02:00:07,762
Don't get angry.

948
02:00:07,763 --> 02:00:11,042
- Don't do this.
- Oh, sure.

949
02:00:11,043 --> 02:00:13,721
Do you want me to make it easier for you?
the things? No.

950
02:00:13,722 --> 02:00:16,921
Of course not!
It won't be easy!

951
02:00:16,922 --> 02:00:19,571
"It's not easy for me."

952
02:01:40,082 --> 02:01:41,841
Hello, it's me.

953
02:01:41,842 --> 02:01:43,610
Leave a message.

954
02:01:52,042 --> 02:01:53,651
hello?

955
02:01:57,842 --> 02:02:00,522
Diane, the car is waiting.

956
02:02:00,523 --> 02:02:02,479
Are you okay?

957
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,288
Will you come?

958
02:02:09,882 --> 02:02:11,720
How good.

959
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:13,809
It means a lot to me.

960
02:02:14,762 --> 02:02:17,530
Come on,
The car is outside your house.

961
02:02:18,441 --> 02:02:20,529
There it has been waiting for you,
Okay?

962
02:02:25,203 --> 02:02:27,081
OK.

963
02:02:27,082 --> 02:02:30,729
It is Mulholland Drive No. 6980.

964
02:02:31,882 --> 02:02:33,969
Mulholland Drive.

965
02:03:40,642 --> 02:03:43,928
What does it do?
We won't stop here.

966
02:03:48,241 --> 02:03:50,769
It's a surprise.

967
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,448
A shortcut.

968
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,968
Come, my love.

969
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:26,039
It's lovely.

970
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:28,169
A secret path.

971
02:05:33,319 --> 02:05:35,006
You arrive just in time.

972
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:37,967
Welcome, Diane.

973
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:45,839
Well...

974
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,088
...here's to love.

975
02:05:57,078 --> 02:05:58,566
For love.

976
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:05,566
Here it is.

977
02:06:14,478 --> 02:06:16,687
I don't think you know my mother.

978
02:06:17,999 --> 02:06:20,398
Hello. I'm Diane Selwyn.

979
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:23,078
Well, tell me Coco.
Like everyone.

980
02:06:23,079 --> 02:06:25,359
Nice to meet you.
Let's go eat.

981
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:27,166
I'm dying of hunger.

982
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,606
I'm sorry I'm late.

983
02:06:54,879 --> 02:06:57,207
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

984
02:06:58,039 --> 02:06:59,958
A small town.

985
02:06:59,959 --> 02:07:03,407
So you came from Canada.

986
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:06,527
I always wanted to come here.

987
02:07:07,918 --> 02:07:10,566
I won a dance contest.

988
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:13,527
And that led me to acting.

989
02:07:15,117 --> 02:07:17,685
You know, wanting to act.

990
02:07:19,038 --> 02:07:21,726
When my aunt died...

991
02:07:22,597 --> 02:07:27,117
Anyway, I inherited some money.
She worked here.

992
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:28,926
In the cinema?

993
02:07:29,838 --> 02:07:32,317
Yes.

994
02:07:32,318 --> 02:07:34,966
Well, how did you meet Camilla?

995
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:38,638
It was in The Story of Silvia North.

996
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:40,726
Camilla acted wonderfully.

997
02:07:55,117 --> 02:07:58,205
I longed for the lead role.

998
02:07:59,278 --> 02:08:01,925
Anyway, they gave the role to Camilla.

999
02:08:04,959 --> 02:08:07,477
The director...

1000
02:08:07,478 --> 02:08:09,717
Bob Brooker?

1001
02:08:09,718 --> 02:08:11,286
Yes.

1002
02:08:13,718 --> 02:08:15,845
He didn't like me very much.

1003
02:08:20,559 --> 02:08:23,566
Well, it was then
when we became friends.

1004
02:08:24,477 --> 02:08:26,397
She helped me...

1005
02:08:26,398 --> 02:08:30,046
...to get papers
in some of his films.

1006
02:08:31,996 --> 02:08:33,404
I see.

1007
02:08:47,597 --> 02:08:50,316
...so I stayed with the pool...

1008
02:08:50,317 --> 02:08:52,526
...and she, with whom she cleans the pools.

1009
02:08:54,358 --> 02:08:58,525
I couldn't believe it. I wanted to buy him
a Rolls Royce to that judge.

1010
02:09:04,877 --> 02:09:07,005
Sometimes good things happen.

1011
02:09:58,636 --> 02:10:01,084
I guess we saved the best
for the end.

1012
02:10:04,196 --> 02:10:05,635
Do you want to tell them?

1013
02:10:05,636 --> 02:10:07,724
No, you tell them.

1014
02:10:11,558 --> 02:10:13,645
Camilla and I...

1015
02:10:25,517 --> 02:10:27,605
...let's...

1016
02:10:38,795 --> 02:10:40,564
I'm sorry.

1017
02:10:48,556 --> 02:10:50,324
No, I'm fine like that.

1018
02:10:55,916 --> 02:10:58,845
She is the girl.

1019
02:10:59,597 --> 02:11:02,604
don't show me
this thing here, damn.

1020
02:11:03,036 --> 02:11:06,445
It's a resume with a photo of an actress.
Everyone has one.

1021
02:11:07,554 --> 02:11:10,153
Do you bring the money?

1022
02:11:10,154 --> 02:11:11,963
Of course yes.

1023
02:11:22,756 --> 02:11:26,964
Well, once you give me that,
The deal is closed.

1024
02:11:29,516 --> 02:11:32,443
Are you sure
what do you want this about?

1025
02:11:36,916 --> 02:11:39,203
More than anything in the world.

1026
02:11:49,835 --> 02:11:52,002
When it's done,
You will find this where I told you.

1027
02:12:05,876 --> 02:12:07,883
What does it open?
